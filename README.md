- This is data from the Chapter 5 Problem 25 of "The Statistical Sleuth".
- It contains 12,000+ rows, each depicting a person with two features, where one feature consists of 5 categories of education levels, and the other feature consists of their income which has a right-skewed distribution.
- Appropriate assumptions are established in preparation for ANOVA testing by visualizing before and after logarithmic transformation.
- The addressed problem statements are as follows:
  - Test if at least one of the five distributions of educated people different from the other distributions.
  - Test if people with 16 years of education have different distributions of income than people with more than 16 years of education.
  - Repeat 2nd objective, but assumes that there is no equal standard deviation for the logged data using Welch's ANOVA test.
